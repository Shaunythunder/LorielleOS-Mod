Tier 2 and 3 screens can act as touch screens - don't attach a keyboard or sneak-activate them.
You can change the text size on screens by changing their resolution - run `resolution 40 16` in the shell.
Use an Analyzer to get more information on blocks - for example, to find out why a computer crashed.
Keyboards have to be attached to or placed next to a screen to work.
Most programs can be interrupted by pressing Ctrl+Alt+C.
Paste the contents of the clipboard using the middle mouse button or a configurable key (default: insert).
Computers will consume less power while idling - i.e. when os.sleep(n > 0.05) is called.
Screens will consume more power the more lit characters they display.
Most blocks act as 'cables' - use relays and power distributors to create separate networks.
Screens can display Unicode - paste the special chars or use unicode.char.
Run `help` or `man programname` for ingame help on programs shipped with LorielleOS - start with `man man`.
Computers have a very basic, built-in speaker - control it using computer.beep().
Many component methods have a short documentation - use `=component.componentName.methodName` in the Lua interpreter to see it.
You can get a list of all attached components using the `components` program.
If you encounter out of memory errors, throw more RAM at your computer.
To disable this greeting, go to your LorielleOS installation and remove the `/etc/motd` line from `/etc/profile.lua`.
Beware of cycles when building networks, or you may get duplicate messages!
